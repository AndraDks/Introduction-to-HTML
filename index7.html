        Saturn is the sixth planet from the Sun and the second-largest in the
        Solar System, after Jupiter. It is a gas giant with an average radius of
        about nine-and-a-half times that of Earth. It has only one-eighth the
        average density of Earth, but is over 95 times more massive. Saturn's
        interior is thought to be composed of a rocky core, surrounded by a deep
        layer of metallic hydrogen, an intermediate layer of liquid hydrogen and
        liquid helium, and finally, a gaseous outer layer. Saturn has a pale
        yellow hue due to ammonia crystals in its upper atmosphere. An
        electrical current within the metallic hydrogen layer is thought to give
        rise to Saturn's planetary magnetic field, which is weaker than Earth's,
        but which has a magnetic moment 580 times that of Earth due to Saturn's
        larger size. Saturn's magnetic field strength is around one-twentieth of
        Jupiter's. The outer atmosphere is generally bland and lacking in
        contrast, although long-lived features can appear. Wind speeds on Saturn
        can reach 1,800 kilometres per hour (1,100 miles per hour). The planet
        has a prominent ring system, which is composed mainly of ice particles,
        with a smaller amount of rocky debris and dust. <u><i><b>At least 146 moons are
        known to orbit the planet</b></i></u>, of which 63 are officially named; this does
        not include the <u><b><i>hundreds of moonlets in its rings</b></i></u>. Titan, Saturn's
        largest moon and the second largest in the Solar System, is larger
        (while less massive) than the planet Mercury and is the only moon in the
        Solar System to have a substantial atmosphere. Saturn is a gas giant
        composed predominantly of hydrogen and helium. It lacks a definite
        surface, though it is likely to have a solid core. Saturn's rotation
        causes it to have the shape of an oblate spheroid; that is, it is
        flattened at the poles and bulges at its equator. <u><i><b>Its equatorial radius
        is more than 10% larger than its polar radius: 60,268 km versus 54,364
        km</b></i></u>. Jupiter, Uranus, and Neptune, the other giant planets in the Solar
        System, are also oblate but to a lesser extent. Saturn's average <u><i><b>temperature, due to its distance from the Sun, hovers around -178Â°C</b></i></u>, making it one of the chilliest planets in our solar system.
