        Jupiter is the fifth planet from the Sun and <b><u><i>the largest in the Solar
        System </i></b></u>. It is a gas giant with a mass more than two and a half times
        that of all the other planets in the Solar System combined, and slightly
        less than one one-thousandth the mass of the Sun. Jupiter orbits the Sun
        at a distance of 5.20 AU (778.5 Gm) with an orbital period of 11.86
        years. Jupiter is the third brightest natural object in the Earth's
        night sky after the Moon and Venus, and it has been observed since
        prehistoric times. It was named after Jupiter, the chief deity of
        ancient Roman religion. The average <u><i><b>temperature on Jupiter is around -145Â°C </b></i></u>, while its vast system boasts an impressive <i><b>count of <u>79 known satellites</b></i></u>. Jupiter was the first planet to form, and its
        inward migration during the primordial Solar System impacted much of the
        formation history of the other planets. Jupiter is primarily composed of
        hydrogen (90% by volume), followed by helium, which makes up a quarter
        of its mass and a tenth of its volume. The ongoing contraction of
        Jupiter's interior generates more heat than the planet receives from the
        Sun. Its internal structure is believed to comprise an outer mantle of
        liquid metallic hydrogen, and a diffuse inner core of denser material.
        Because of its rapid rotation rate of 1 rotation per 10 hours, Jupiter's
        shape is an oblate spheroid: it has a slight but noticeable bulge around
        the equator.
